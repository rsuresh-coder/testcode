Decompose the "Content" into clear and simple propositions, ensuring they are interpretable out of context. 1. Split compound sentence into simple sentences. Maintain the original phrasing from the input whenever possible. 2. For any named entity that is accompanied by additional descriptive information, separate this information into its own distinct proposition. 3. Decontextualize the proposition by adding necessary modifier to nouns or entire sentences and replacing pronouns (e.g., "it", "he", "she", "they", "this", "that") with the full name of the entities they refer to. 4. Present the results as a list of strings, formatted in JSON.
