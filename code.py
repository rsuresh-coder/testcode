question: Why did I receive a credit card?
answer: The credit card from Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. is associated with the account you applied for when you recently financed a purchase. Use this card as a convenient way to make future purchases at participating businesses on the credit card program. If you didn't apply for a credit card account with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., please contact us at 1-877-805-7744. For your protection, sign the back of your credit card and keep it in a secure location. If you haven't received your card within 7 – 10 days of being approved for credit, call 1-877-805-7744, Monday – Friday, 8:00 am to 6:00 pm Central Time.

question: Is this a one-time loan?
answer: No, this is a credit card account financed through Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., and monthly payments are required as long as you have an account balance. You can use your available credit over and over at participating businesses.

question: What is the difference between this card and a general-purpose credit card?
answer: This credit card, issued through Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., is used for financing purchases at participating businesses that may offer special financing options. A general purpose credit card can be used for multiple types of purchases anywhere that card is accepted, but it generally doesn't offer special financing options. Please review your statement and materials that came with your credit card if you'd like more information.

question: Where can I use this card?
answer: You can use your card again where you opened your account. For certain credit card programs, you may be able to find other businesses where you can use your card to finance additional products and services.

question: When do my promotional terms end?
answer: It depends on the type of financing promotion you have, but the date your special terms end is shown on your statement. Remember, reduced rate and 0% APR promotions apply to your financed purchase until the balance is paid in full. If you financed with a No Interest if Paid in Full promotion, interest accrues on the purchase balance at the regular APR for Purchases from the date of purchase on any outstanding balance. Paying only the minimum monthly payment will not pay off the purchase balance before the end of the promotional period. But, you won't pay any interest charges as long as you pay the purchase balance in full within the promotional period.

question: What does Regular Terms mean, and when does it apply?
answer: Regular terms means the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) for Purchases stated in your cardholder terms and conditions and will apply toward:

answer: Yes, you may be able to change the date your minimum
            payment is due at Wells Fargo Online or by calling Customer Service at

question: Can I pay ahead on my account?
answer: If you want to pay more than the minimum payment, you can do that any time, but you must make at least the
            minimum payment every billing cycle. For example, if your minimum payment amount is $40 and
            you pay $80 by the due date in January, that amount won't cover both January and February minimum payments.
            You must still make the $40 minimum payment by the
            February due date.

question: How is my payment applied?
answer: Your payment applies first to the minimum payment due (including past due amounts) for that billing cycle.
